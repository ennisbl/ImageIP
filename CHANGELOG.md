## [1.1.1] - 2025-09-01

### üîß Version Management Optimization

### Fixed
- **Version centralization**: Resolved setuptools import conflicts by keeping VERSION in setup.py
- **Import optimization**: Implemented file-reading approach to avoid circular imports
- **Build system stability**: Fixed external_builder.py to work without triggering setuptools
- **Cleaner architecture**: All modules now safely read version from setup.py without import issues

### Technical Improvements
- Centralized version management with setup.py as single source of truth
- Safe version reading without setuptools interference
- Improved module import reliability
- Enhanced build system compatibility

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-01

### üßπ Repository Cleanup & Professional Build System

### Added
- **External build system** for clean, professional builds
- **Repository cleanup** removing 50%+ build artifacts and clutter  
- **Enhanced .gitignore** to prevent future build pollution
- **Streamlined codebase** down to 19 essential files
- **Professional development workflow** with separated build environment
- **Reusable build scripts** that can be used for future versions

### Changed
- **Repository structure** now contains only essential source code and documentation
- **Build process** moved to external workspace to maintain clean repository
- **Version bumped** to 1.1.0 for the cleaned release

### Removed
- **Build artifacts** (build/, dist/, __pycache__, *.spec files)
- **Excessive documentation** (duplicate build guides, summary files)
- **Development scripts** moved to external build system
- **Version artifacts** and temporary files

### Technical Improvements
- **Clean git history** with proper separation of source vs. build
- **Faster repository cloning** due to reduced file count
- **Professional software development practices** implemented
- **Maintainable codebase** with clear organization
